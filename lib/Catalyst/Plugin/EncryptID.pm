=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::EncryptID - Obfuscate IDs/string in URLs

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module makes easy to obfuscate internal IDs when using them in a URL given to users.
Instead of seeing L<http://example.com/item/42>
users will see L<http://example.com/item/c98ea08a8e8ad715> .
This will prevent nosy users from trying to iterate all items based on a simple ID in the URL.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Configuration requires a secret key at a minimum.

Or set the secret key at run time, with:
    BEGIN {
		TestApp->config(
			name    => 'TestApp',
			EncryptID => {
				secret => 'abc123xyz',
				padding_character => '!'
			}
		);
    }

=cut

sub _padding_character {
	my ( $c ) = @_;
	my $config = $c->config->{EncryptID};
	return $config->{padding_character} || '!'	
}

sub _secret {
	my ( $c ) = @_;
	my $config = $c->config->{EncryptID};
	my $secret = $config->{secret} || ':-) - :-)';
	die "Key must be 8 byte long" if length($secret) < 8;
	return $secret;
}

sub _cipher {
	my ( $c ) = @_;
	my $secret = _secret($c);
	return Crypt::Blowfish->new($secret);
}

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Quick summary of what the module does.

Perhaps a little code snippet.

    use Catalyst::Plugin::EncryptID;

    my $foo = Catalyst::Plugin::EncryptID->new();
    ...

=head1 EXPORT

A list of functions that can be exported.  You can delete this section
if you don't export anything, such as for a purely object-oriented module.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 encrypt_data

C<encrypt_data(ID [,PREFIX])> - Encrypt the given ID, returns the encoded hash value.
			     If "PREFIX" is given, it will be added to the ID before encoding.
			     It can be used when decoding to verify the decoded value is valid.

=cut

sub encrypt_data {
	my( $c, $text, $prefix ) = @_;

	warn "Missing Clear text ID parameter" unless defined $text;
	return unless defined $text;

	## Prefix is optional, can be undef
	$text = $prefix . $text if defined $prefix;

	my $min_length = 8;
	my $ciphertext_hash = '';

	#encode an empty string
	$text = _padding_character($c) x $min_length if length($text) < 1;

	while ( length($text) > 0 ) {
		my $sub_text = substr($text,0,$min_length,'');
		if ( length($sub_text) < 8 ) {
			my $left = $min_length - length($sub_text);
			$sub_text = ( _padding_character($c) x ($left % $min_length) ). $sub_text;
		};

		my $ciphertext = _cipher($c)->encrypt($sub_text);
		$ciphertext_hash .= unpack('H16', $ciphertext ) ;
	}

	return $ciphertext_hash;
}

=head2 decrypt_data

C<decrypt_data(ID)> - Decrypt the given ID, returns the original (text) ID value.

=cut

sub decrypt_data {
	my( $c, $encrypted_hash ) = @_;

	return unless is_valid_encrypt_hash( $c, $encrypted_hash );

	my $padding_character = _padding_character($c);
	my $ciphertext = '';

	while ( length($encrypted_hash) > 0 ) {
		my $sub_text   = substr($encrypted_hash,0,16,'');
		my $cipherhash = pack('H16', $sub_text );
		my $text = _cipher($c)->decrypt($cipherhash);

		$text =~ s/^$padding_character+//;
		$ciphertext .= $text;
	};
	return $ciphertext
}

=head2 is_valid_encrypt_hash

C<is_valid_encrypt_hash(HASH)> - Return true if given encrypt has is valid

=cut

sub is_valid_encrypt_hash {
	my( $c, $encrypted_hash ) = @_;
	return 0 unless length($encrypted_hash);
	return 0 unless length($encrypted_hash)%16 == 0;
	return 0 unless $encrypted_hash =~ /^[0-9A-F]+$/i;
	return 1;
